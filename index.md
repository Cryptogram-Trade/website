## Cryptogram, your private and secured crypto trading companion


We provide you with tools to buy and spend crypto with full anonymity.
At Cryptogram, we believe that digital money should be private business and respectful of identies.
Our team work hard for that, one day at a time.


## Buy Crypto without a KYC

Do you need to buy crypto and you don't want to be verified?
Just send us your payment via bank wire and we convert it to stable coin before transfering it back to you.
The only charge is 8% of the value at the time of conversion!

### How to proceed?

1. Get in touch with the team mentioning how much you want to transfer and your USDT address
2. Send your Fiat money with the exact reference and amount mentioned. Make an immediate transfer if your bank permits
3. We convert your Fiat to stable Crypto (USDT or one of your choice) and send it to the address you provided

We permit deposits between 1000 USD and 100,000 USD (or equivalent EUR, GBP...) at a time.

> A good practice is to transfer an amount that is almost unique.
> eg: instead of depositing $75,000 you may prefer $14,969. This permits us to eeasily match your deposit with a maximal anonymity for you.
