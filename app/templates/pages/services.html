  trading companion</h2>

<p>We provide you with tools to buy and spend crypto with full anonymity.
  At Cryptogram, we believe that digital money should be private business and respectful of identies.
  Our team work hard for that, one day at a time.</p>

<h2 id="buy-crypto-without-a-kyc">Buy Crypto without a KYC</h2>

<p>Some of our clients need to deal with crypto and cannot be verified users.
  For these clients Cryptogram provides a great help thanks to our diverse partners.</p>

<p>We work with Coinbase Pro, Kraken and other great crypto exchange in order to send your Fiat.</p>

<p>We will provide you with a temporary Fiat deposit account in one of these exchange.
  We then convert it to stable coin before transfering it back to your personal account.
  The only fee is a flat 8% of the value at the time of conversion with no volatility!</p>

<h3 id="how-to-proceed">How to proceed?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Get in touch with the team mentioning how much you want to transfer and your USDT address</li>
  <li>Send your Fiat money with the exact reference and amount mentioned. Make an immediate transfer if your bank
    permits (available in a few minutes) or a regular transfer (one to 5 working days).</li>
  <li>We convert your Fiat to stable Crypto (USDT or one of your choice) and send it to the wallet address you provided.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You may deposit any amount up to 100,000 USD (or equivalent EUR, GBP…) at a time.
  However for amount below $2,500 a flat fee of 200USDT will be charged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good practice is to transfer an amount that makes it almost unique.
    eg: instead of depositing $75,000 you may prefer to deposit $74,969. This permits our partner or ourselves to easily
    find and match your deposit with a full anonymity for you.</p>

<h2 id="manage-your-cryptos-from-shrimpy">Manage your cryptos from Shrimpy</h2>

<p>Shrimpy is a great way to deal with crypto via porrtrfolios.
  It provides sustainable tools to manage your daily trades.</p>

<p>Cryptogram goes one step further and provides extra tools to save money and improve the Shrimpy app.</p>

<h3 id="shrimpy-augmented">Shrimpy augmented</h3>

<p>At Cryptogram we love Shrimpy. Shrimpy is an online app that lets you trade, rebalance and copy portrfolio in a
  breeze.
  It’s a great way to make a first step in the crypto world or for advanced users to earn sharing their knowledge.</p>

<p>Shrimpy is privacy friendly (they never ask who you are) and connects to many exhanges.</p>

<p>At Cryptogram we made tools to provide you with a better and more advanced features to enrich your Shrimpy
  experience.
  We’re still a little secret about that and we’ll come with some news about these features around end of April.</p>

<h3 id="shrimpy-for-binance-us-users">Shrimpy for Binance US users</h3>

<p>If you are a US citizen using Shrimpy and Binance, you must have met the restriction
  to follow the best leaders out there.
  Most good leaders are on the regular Binance app.</p>

<p>A first solution is to use a VPN and relocalize your geographic position.
  Even though you should use a VPN in any case, faking your Binance account is risky.</p>

<p>Binance could close your account immediatly with no possibility to re-access it nor
  claiming for your crypto. That’s a game not many of us want to play.</p>

<p>Cryptogram offers a safe way to use your Binance.us account and follow any other Binance leader.</p>

<h3 id="follow-a-binance-leader-with-a-us-account-on-shrimpy">Follow a Binance leader with a US account on Shrimpy</h3>

<p>Shrimpy does not offer a way to follow any other account than Binance US.</p>

<p>Cryptogram removes that restriction and permits a Binance,us user to follow any other regular
  Binance leader with the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to your Shrimpy account and create an API key.</li>
  <li>On your Cryptogram account, insert your Shrimpy API key.</li>
  <li>credit your account with a certain amount (5% of your portfolio should be a good start)</li>
  <li>Browse for leaders and select the one you want to follow</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your credit will be used to cover the follower fees.
    Fees only apply on benefits calculated hourly (for hh:00:00 to hh:59:59). If during that period you leader stalled
    or had deficit no credit is taken.</p>
